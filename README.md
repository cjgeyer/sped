(Thompson, 1983, [doi:10.1098/rspb.1983.0072](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1983.0072))
and special cases thereof
(Thompson, 1986, [doi:10.1002/zoo.1430050210](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/zoo.1430050210))
including kinship coefficients.  But does much more:
probabilities of any set of genes descending from any other
set of genes.
